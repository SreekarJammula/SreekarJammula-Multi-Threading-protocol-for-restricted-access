# SreekarJammula-Multi-Threading-protocol-for-restricted-access
• Developed a proof of concept that utilizes POSIX threads and semaphores to restrict access for the user defined threads • The aim was not to allow two dissimilar threads to have access to the same place at the same time • Major challenge was to ensure that there was no deadlock situation among the threads
